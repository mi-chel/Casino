Welcome to the wonderful world of slot machines! Here's how to play:
Start by choosing your bet amount. You can choose any amount within your available balance. 
This slot machine allows you to bet on up to three lines. You can bet on just one line, two lines, or all three for a higher chance to win. 
Press enter to spin: Once you've set your bet and chosen your lines, press the "Enter" button to start the game. The reels will spin and eventually stop, revealing a combination of symbols across your selected lines.
If any of your selected lines show a winning combination of symbols (e.g., three matching symbols in a row), you'll win a payout based on the bet amount and the specific combination.
Single Line Wins: If you bet on just one line and it wins, you'll receive the payout for that line.
Multiple Line Wins: If you bet on two or three lines and multiple lines win, your winnings will be multiplied accordingly.
If you've won, your winnings will be added to your balance automatically.
You can choose to place another bet and spin again, or you can cash out your winnings and end the game.
