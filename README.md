# Slot Machine
Welcome to the wonderful world of slot machines! Here's how to play:
1. Start by choosing your bet amount. You can choose any amount within your available balance. 
2. This slot machine allows you to bet on up to three lines. You can bet on just one line, two lines, or all three for a higher chance to win. 
3. Press enter to spin: Once you've set your bet and chosen your lines, press the "Enter" button to start the game. The reels will spin and eventually stop, revealing a combination of symbols across your selected lines.
  - If any of your selected lines show a winning combination of symbols (e.g., three matching symbols in a row), you'll win a payout based on the bet amount and the specific combination.
  - Single Line Wins: If you bet on just one line and it wins, you'll receive the payout for that line.
  - Multiple Line Wins: If you bet on two or three lines and multiple lines win, your winnings will be multiplied accordingly.
4. If you've won, your winnings will be added to your balance automatically.
5. You can choose to place another bet and spin again, or you can cash out your winnings and end the game.
# Blackjack
Blackjack is a popular card game where the goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. Here's how to play:
1. Start by placing your bet within the allowed range.
2. You'll receive two cards, both face up. The dealer also gets two cards, but one is revealed and the other is not.
3. Card Values:
  - Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
  - Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more favorable for your hand.
4. There are two actions you can perform.
  - Hit: Ask for another card if you want to try to get closer to 21.
  - Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
5. Once you've finished your turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card. The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher.
6. You win if:
  - Your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s without going over.
  - You hit exactly 21 (Blackjack) with your first two cards.
7. You lose if:
  - Your hand exceeds 21 (busts).
  - The dealer’s hand is closer to 21 than yours.
8. If you're satisfied with your winnings (or want to cut your losses), you can cash out and end the game.
# Spin the Wheel
Here's how to play:
1. Choose your bet amount within your available balance, including precise decimal amounts for added flexibility.
2. After placing your bet, press the "Enter" button. There are six different colored segments, each representing a unique outcome, that the wheel will land on.
3. The wheel will eventually stop, and the pointer will land on one of the six colored segments. Each color corresponds to a specific outcome:
  - Green: Doubles your bet.
  - Blue: Halves your money.
  - Yellow: Increases your bet by 1.5 times.
  - Red: Wins your bet.
  - Orange: You lose your bet.
  - Purple: Gives you another spin, keeping your current bet in play.
4. After the outcome is revealed, you can choose to place another bet and spin the wheel again.
5. If you're satisfied with your winnings (or want to cut your losses), you can cash out and end the game.
